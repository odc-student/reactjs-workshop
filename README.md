### ReactJS Workshop: Create, Read, Update

This workshop is designed to help you learn how to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using ReactJS. In this workshop, you will learn how to create a form for adding new items, display a list of existing items, and update and delete existing items.

## Prerequisites

Before you can complete this workshop, you will need the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Node.js and npm installed on your computer

- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for editing code


## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download this repository to your computer. Open the repository in your text editor or IDE and run the following command in the terminal to install the required dependencies:


"npm install"

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

"npm start"

This will start the development server and open a web browser at "http://localhost:3000", where you can see the application running.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── ItemForm.js
│   │   ├── ItemList.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── package.json
└── ...

The public folder contains the HTML file that the React application is rendered in. The src folder contains the JavaScript code that makes up the application. The components folder contains reusable React components for the form and list.

## Workshop Tasks

The workshop is divided into the following tasks:

- Creating the Item Form Component

- Creating the Item List Component

- Adding State to the App Component

- Implementing Create Item

- Implementing Update Item

- Implementing Delete Item

Each task builds on the previous one, and the instructions for each task are provided in the respective task files.

To get started with the first task, open the src/components/ItemForm.js file and follow the instructions in the comments. Once you have completed a task, run the application and test the functionality before moving on to the next task.

## Conclusion


Congratulations! You have completed this ReactJS workshop on creating, reading, and updating items in a CRUD application. You should now have a solid understanding of how to use React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, as well as how to manage state and data in a React application. Feel free to experiment with the application and make modifications to the code to further your learning.
